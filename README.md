## Modules of System
The scope of the task of this system designed for pet stores is stated in the following articles:
* The system has a panel that can be managed by the sales person. To log in to this panel, the salesperson needs a username and password.
* Customer registration can be created by the sales person. After the recorded information, it is not necessary to be informed again about the customer's other purchases.
* By easily adding the registration of products to the system, products such as food, toys and accessories can be divided into categories. Thanks to this, salespeople can find products faster and easier.
* The sales person can view the total price by entering the list of products purchased by the registered customer and the necessary information. He/She can do billing.
* An output can be created after the billing process. The number of products in stock is automatically updated after sales.
* The animal part, which is located as a separate section in the system, makes it easier for pets in the store to meet with potential owners effectively. This feature helps pet stores to manage the pet adoption process more systematically.
